  abstract  = {Drug discovery and development pipelines are long, complex and depend on numerous factors. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with theÂ lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},

  abstract  = {Clinical research can be remarkably enhanced making use of virtual screening techniques
that predicts how ligands interact with pharmacological receptors. This accelerates
the long and expensive process of finding new drugs. Current methods often involve
computer clusters that require high computational cost and several programming models.
As an alternative to alleviate these problems, we developed DQN-Docking, a novel approach
that takes advantage of the latest breakthroughs achieved in deep reinforcement learning
by applying a Deep Q-Network to the context of protein-ligand docking prediction.
The goal is to design a system able to "teach" the agent--the ligand--how to successfully
couple with the receptor by an iterative trial-and-error process. A Deep Q-Network
estimates the Q-value function to guide the agent to move in the environment, while
METADOCK, a parallel metaheuristic schema for virtual screening methods, provides
the resulting state of those movements and its corresponding docking score. Preliminary
results seem promising but more research needs to be conducted to refine DQN-Docking
and make it an effective alternative to solve the molecular Docking problem.},

  abstract  = {To plan the syntheses of small organic molecules, chemists use retrosynthesis, a problem-solving technique in which target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.},
