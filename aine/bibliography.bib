  abstract  = {Drug discovery and development pipelines are long, complex and depend on numerous factors. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},

  abstract  = {Clinical research can be remarkably enhanced making use of virtual screening techniques
that predicts how ligands interact with pharmacological receptors. This accelerates
the long and expensive process of finding new drugs. Current methods often involve
computer clusters that require high computational cost and several programming models.
As an alternative to alleviate these problems, we developed DQN-Docking, a novel approach
that takes advantage of the latest breakthroughs achieved in deep reinforcement learning
by applying a Deep Q-Network to the context of protein-ligand docking prediction.
The goal is to design a system able to "teach" the agent--the ligand--how to successfully
couple with the receptor by an iterative trial-and-error process. A Deep Q-Network
estimates the Q-value function to guide the agent to move in the environment, while
METADOCK, a parallel metaheuristic schema for virtual screening methods, provides
the resulting state of those movements and its corresponding docking score. Preliminary
results seem promising but more research needs to be conducted to refine DQN-Docking
and make it an effective alternative to solve the molecular Docking problem.},

  abstract  = {To plan the syntheses of small organic molecules, chemists use retrosynthesis, a problem-solving technique in which target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.},

molecules is very large (10 23 - 10 60 ), a common technique during drug discovery
is to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties. An interdisciplinary
team of scientists generates hypothesis about the required changes to the prototype.
In this work, we develop an algorithmic unsupervised-approach that automatically generates
potential drug molecules given a prototype drug. We show that the molecules generated
by the system are valid molecules and significantly different from the prototype drug.
Out of the compounds generated by the system, we identified 35 FDA-approved drugs.
As an example, our system generated Isoniazid - one of the main drugs for Tuberculosis.
The system is currently being deployed for use in collaboration with pharmaceutical
companies to further analyze the additional generated molecules.},

  abstract  = {Synthetic organic chemistry underpins several areas of chemistry, including drug discovery, chemical biology, materials science and engineering. However, the execution of complex chemical syntheses in itself requires expert knowledge, usually acquired over many years of study and hands-on laboratory practice. The development of technologies with potential to streamline and automate chemical synthesis is a half-century-old endeavour yet to be fulfilled. Renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven by improved computing power, data availability and algorithms, is overturning the limited success previously obtained. In this Review, we discuss the recent impact of AI on different tasks of synthetic chemistry and dissect selected examples from the literature. By examining the underlying concepts, we aim to demystify AI for bench chemists in order that they may embrace it as a tool rather than fear it as a competitor, spur future research by pinpointing the gaps in knowledge and delineate how chemical AI will run in the era of digital chemistry. Artificial intelligence has recently seen numerous applications in synthetic organic chemistry. Advanced pattern-recognition heuristics may facilitate the access to chemical matter of interest and complement chemical intuition in the near future.},

part of the drug discovery process. Failure to meet one of the required properties
can frequently lead to failure in a clinical test which is costly. In addition, optimizing
these multiple properties is a challenging task because the optimization of one property
is prone to changing other properties. In this paper, we pose this multi-property
optimization problem as a sequence translation process and propose a new optimized
molecule generator model based on the Transformer with two constraint networks: property
prediction and similarity prediction. We further improve the model by incorporating
score predictions from these constraint networks in a modified beam search algorithm.
The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model, Controlled Molecule Generator
(CMG), outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin for optimizing
multiple properties simultaneously.},

These leverage the generally bigger datasets created from high-throughput screening data and allow prediction of bioactivities for targets and molecular properties with increased levels of accuracy. We have only just begun to exploit the potential of these techniques but they may already be fundamentally changing the research process for identifying new molecules and/or repurposing old drugs. The integrated application of such machine learning models for end-to-end (E2E) application is broadly relevant and has considerable implications for developing future therapies and their targeting.},

  abstract = {We have devised and implemented a novel computational strategy for de novo design of molecules with desired properties termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution). On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks-generative and predictive-that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo-generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.},
