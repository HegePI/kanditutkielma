  abstract  = {Drug discovery and development pipelines are long, complex and depend on numerous
  factors. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery
  and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities
  to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation,
  identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical
  trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding
  accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack
  of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application.
  In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With
  ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to
  validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the
  potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},

@article{deAlmeidaA.Filipa2019Socd,
  abstract  = {Synthetic organic chemistry underpins several areas of chemistry, including
  drug discovery, chemical biology, materials science and engineering. However, the
  execution of complex chemical syntheses in itself requires expert knowledge, usually acquired
  over many years of study and hands-on laboratory practice. The development of technologies with
  potential to streamline and automate chemical synthesis is a half-century-old endeavour yet to be
  fulfilled. Renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven by improved computing
  power, data availability and algorithms, is overturning the limited success previously obtained.
  In this Review, we discuss the recent impact of AI on different tasks of synthetic chemistry and
  dissect selected examples from the literature. By examining the underlying concepts, we aim to
  demystify AI for bench chemists in order that they may embrace it as a tool rather than fear it
  as a competitor, spur future research by pinpointing the gaps in knowledge and delineate how chemical
  AI will run in the era of digital chemistry. Artificial intelligence has recently seen numerous
  applications in synthetic organic chemistry. Advanced pattern-recognition heuristics may facilitate
  the access to chemical matter of interest and complement chemical intuition in the near future.},

  abstract = {Training algorithms to computationally plan multistep organic syntheses has been a challenge for more than 50 years
. However, the field has progressed greatly since the development of early programs such as LHASA
, for which reaction choices at each step were made by human operators. Multiple software platforms
are now capable of completely autonomous planning. But these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets, the syntheses of which could arguably be designed by human chemists within minutes, without the help of a computer. Furthermore, no algorithm has yet been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products, for which much more far-sighted, multistep planning is necessary
and closely related literature precedents cannot be relied on. Here we demonstrate that such computational synthesis planning is possible, provided that the program's knowledge of organic chemistry and data-based artificial intelligence routines are augmented with causal relationships
, allowing it to 'strategize' over multiple synthetic steps. Using a Turing-like test administered to synthesis experts, we show that the routes designed by such a program are largely indistinguishable from those designed by humans. We also successfully validated three computer-designed syntheses of natural products in the laboratory. Taken together, these results indicate that expert-level automated synthetic planning is feasible, pending continued improvements to the reaction knowledge base and further code optimization.},

# Retrosynthesis
@article{ColeyConnorW2018MLiC,
  abstract  = {Conspectus Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating
  the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program
  would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each
  connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps.
  Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible
  retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions,
  and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States
  Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated
  reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis
  planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is
  advancing rapidly. In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning
  approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a
  recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how
  the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing 
  number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe
  how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever
  use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem
  of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a
  computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental
  success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the
  prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches
  that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published
  experimental data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines,
  not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving.
  While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure–activity models in chemistry, it
  is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design.
  As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several
  remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of
  both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.},

# De novo drug design, based on desired property vector / new molecule property prediction
@article{PopovaMariya2018Drlf,
  abstract = {We have devised and implemented a novel computational strategy for de novo design of
  molecules with desired properties termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution).
  On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural
  networks-generative and predictive-that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel
  targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input
  line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to
  produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties
  of the de novo-generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained
  separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the
  RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or
  biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries
  with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of
  physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity
  against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted
  chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.},

the resulting state of those movements and its corresponding docking score. Preliminary
results seem promising but more research needs to be conducted to refine DQN-Docking
and make it an effective alternative to solve the molecular Docking problem.},

  abstract  = {Drug discovery is all about finding small molecules that interact in a desired
  way with larger molecules, namely proteins and other macromolecules in the human body. If the
  three-dimensional structures of both the small and large molecule are known, their interaction
  can be tested by computer simulation with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Alternatively, if
  active ligands are already available, molecular similarity searches can be used to find new
  molecules. This virtual screening can even be applied to compounds that have yet to be synthesized,
  as opposed to "real" screening that requires cost- and labor-intensive laboratory testing with
  previously synthesized drug compounds. Unique in its focus on the end user, this is a real "how to"
  book that does not presuppose prior experience in virtual screening or a background in computational
  chemistry. It is both a desktop reference and practical guide to virtual screening applications in
  drug discovery, offering a comprehensive and up-to-date overview. Clearly divided into four major
  sections, the first provides a detailed description of the methods required for and applied in
  virtual screening, while the second discusses the most important challenges in order to improve the
  impact and success of this technique. The third and fourth, practical parts contain practical
  guidelines and several case studies covering the most important scenarios for new drug discovery,
  accompanied by general guidelines for the entire workflow of virtual screening studies. Throughout
  the text, medicinal chemists from academia, as well as from large and small pharmaceutical companies
  report on their experience and pass on priceless practical advice on how to make best use of these
  powerful methods.},
